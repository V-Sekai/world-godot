	<brief_description>
		Encapsulates the result of a planning operation, including the final state, solution graph, and success status.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[PlannerResult] is returned by planning methods ([method PlannerPlan.find_plan], [method PlannerPlan.run_lazy_lookahead], [method PlannerPlan.run_lazy_refineahead]) and contains the outcome of the planning process. It provides access to the final state, the complete solution graph structure, and helper methods for inspecting the graph and extracting plans. The solution graph can be used with [method PlannerPlan.simulate] and [method PlannerPlan.replan] for plan execution and replanning.

	<methods>
		<method name="explain_plan" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Dictionary" />
			<description>
				Returns a [Dictionary] containing an explanation of why this plan was chosen. Includes overall plan statistics (node counts, plan length), decision points where alternatives were considered, and selected methods with their scores. This is useful for understanding planner behavior and debugging planning issues.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="extract_plan" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Array" />
			<param index="0" name="verbose" type="int" default="0" />
			<description>
				Extracts the sequence of commands from the solution graph. Returns an [Array] of command arrays, where each command array has the format "command_name", "arg1", "arg2", etc. Only successfully completed (CLOSED) commands are included in the extracted plan.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="find_failed_nodes" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Array" />
			<description>
				Returns an [Array] of [Dictionary] objects representing all nodes in the solution graph that have a FAILED status. Each dictionary contains "node_id", "type", and "info" keys. This is useful for identifying which nodes failed during planning, which can then be used with [method PlannerPlan.replan] to generate alternative plans.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_all_nodes" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Array" />
			<description>
				Returns an [Array] of [Dictionary] objects representing all nodes in the solution graph. Each dictionary contains "node_id", "type", "status", "info", and "tag" keys. This provides a complete overview of the planning graph structure and can be used for debugging or visualization.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_alternative_methods" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Array" />
			<param index="0" name="node_id" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns an [Array] of [Dictionary] objects representing alternative methods that were considered for the specified node but not selected. Each dictionary contains "method_id", "score", "activity", "subtask_count", and "subtasks" keys. Only available if decision tracking was enabled during planning (verbose &gt;= 2).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_decision_path" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Dictionary" />
			<param index="0" name="node_id" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns a [Dictionary] containing the decision path from the root node to the specified node. The dictionary includes a "path" array of nodes in the decision chain, "length" (number of nodes in path), and "target_node_id". Each node in the path includes decision information if available. Useful for tracing how the planner reached a specific decision.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_node" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Dictionary" />
			<param index="0" name="node_id" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns the node [Dictionary] for the specified node_id from the solution graph. The dictionary contains all node properties including "type", "status", "info", "tag", "successors", etc. Returns an empty dictionary if the node_id does not exist.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_node_explanation" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="String" />
			<param index="0" name="node_id" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns a human-readable [String] explanation for a specific node, including why the method was selected, the selection score, alternative methods considered, and node status. Returns an error message if the node does not exist.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="has_node" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="node_id" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns true if the solution graph contains a node with the specified node_id, false otherwise.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="to_graph_json" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Dictionary" />
			<description>
				Exports the plan graph as a [Dictionary] in JSON-compatible format for web-based visualization. The dictionary includes "nodes" (array of node objects with id, type, status, info, decision_info) and "edges" (array of edge objects with from/to node IDs). Can be used with visualization libraries like D3.js, Cytoscape.js, or vis.js.

	<members>
		<member name="final_state" type="Dictionary" setter="set_final_state" getter="get_final_state" default="{}">
			The final state [Dictionary] after planning completes. This represents the world state after all commands in the plan have been executed.
		</member>
		<member name="solution_graph" type="Dictionary" setter="set_solution_graph" getter="get_solution_graph" default="{}">
			The complete solution graph [Dictionary] containing all nodes created during planning. The dictionary uses node IDs as keys and node dictionaries as values. This graph structure can be used for replanning, simulation, and detailed plan inspection.

			Whether the planning operation succeeded. If true, a valid plan was found and all tasks were completed. If false, planning failed and no valid plan exists.
