# V-Sekai.flac

Module for the [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) to add FLAC playback support. Uses [dr_flac](https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs). Adds "AudioStreamFLAC" resource.

Supports 4.2.

## Installation
Like with any other Godot module, you'll have to compile the engine yourself. Put everything from the modules and thirdparty folders into the respective folders in the Godot source directory, then compile following the [compilation instructions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/) for your platform.
